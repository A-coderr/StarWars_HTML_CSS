		 <p>Before he became a disciple of the dark side, Darth Vader was Anakin Skywalker,
		 a goodhearted Jedi and hero of the Clone Wars. While he was considered one of the
		 most powerful Jedi in the galaxy, Anakin had broken the Order’s code by secretly
		 marrying Senator Padmé Amidala. When he began to suffer visions that Padmé would
		 die in childbirth, Anakin sought a way to prevent this fate. Supreme Chancellor
		 Palpatine, a mentor to the young Jedi, claimed that the dark side was a pathway
		 to this ability: he could stop people from dying with Sith power. At the same
		 time, the Chancellor revealed that he himself was a Sith Lord, Darth Sidious,
		 and would train Anakin. Confused and conflicted, Anakin ultimately succumbed to
		 Sidious’ temptations. Rechristened as Darth Vader, he became an agent of evil. 
		 <br><br>Sidious assumed the mantle of Emperor, and Vader helped the Empire destroy the
		 Jedi Order; without mercy, Anakin led a legion of clones into the Jedi Temple,
		 and personally killed both fully trained Jedi and novice younglings alike.
		 On the lava planet Mustafar, where he had been sent to assassinate Separatist
		 leaders, Vader battled his former Master and friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
		 Anakin fought with an aggressive ferocity, ignoring Obi-Wan's pleas to
		 come to his senses. Ultimately, the Jedi Master bested the new Sith. 
		 Vader was left severely injured and burned on the banks of a lava river,
		 filled with anger and hate. He was found by the Emperor and encased in frightening
		 black armor that kept him alive, and given mechanical lungs that emitted an 
		 ominous breathing sound with his every step. Anakin Skywalker was no more.</p>

		 <p>When the plans for the Death Star were stolen, Vader would take action 
		 to clean up Krennic's mess, personally slaughtering a squad of rebel soldiers
		 and leading the hunt for the data tapes.
		 <br><br>
		 Nineteen years after his battle with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader remained the
		 Empire’s tyrannical hand. Upon the Rebel Alliance’s theft of schematics for the
		 Empire’s ultimate weapon, the planet-sized Death Star, Vader led an attack on
		 a suspected Rebel vessel, seeking to recover the stolen plans and find the
		 location of the Rebel base. Meanwhile, Rebel leader Princess Leia hid the
		 data tapes -- and a distress message -- inside the droid R2-D2, sending him 
		 to Tatooine in search of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Vader and his stormtroopers killed 
		 all aboard with the exception of the Princess, opting to take her to the Death
		 Star for interrogation. Leia proved able to resist a mind probe, and Obi-Wan
		 Kenobi, having received Artoo’s message, soon arrived with the astromech,
		 Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and C-3PO. Vader and Obi-Wan clashed one
		 last time, with the Sith Lord striking down his former Master. Luke, Leia,
		 and the heroes were able to escape, but only because the Empire allowed it:
		 Vader had placed a tracking device on their ship, which led the Empire to
		 the Rebel’s secret base. As the Death Star closed in, the Rebels mounted
		 an attack, with Vader himself entering the fray in his TIE Advanced starfighter.
		 Streaming through the Death Star trench and about to finish off the last of
		 the Rebels -- Luke Skywalker in his X-wing -- Vader and his wingmen were attacked
		 from behind by the Millennium Falcon. Ricocheted away from the Death Star and
		 spun out of control, Vader was unable to stop Luke. The space station was
		 destroyed, but Vader survived, and he flew into the far reaches of space.</p>
