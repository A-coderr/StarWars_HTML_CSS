			Yet a certain plucky droid remained: R2-D2, a white and blue model.
			He successfully restored the ship’s shields, giving it the chance needed
			to make the jump to hyperspace. R2-D2 was recognized by 
			the Queen for his service, and he would accompany her handmaiden,
			Padmé, Jar Jar Binks, and Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn when they reached Tatooine.
			On the desert planet, he was introduced to a still-under-construction 
			protocol droid called C-3PO. They were fast friends,

		   <p>After years of tyrannical Imperial rule, a fledgling Rebellion won
			its first real victory against the Empire by stealing plans to its
			dreaded Death Star. Darth Vader tracked the schematics to the Tantive IV,
			which he boarded with a squad of stormtroopers. Princess Leia Organa,
			a secret Rebel leader, hid the data tapes in the memory banks of R2-D2,
			and the astromech jettisoned the ship with C-3PO. 
			Landing on Tatooine, the droids were captured by Jawas and sold to Owen Lars,
			a moisture farmer; Lars charged his nephew, Luke Skywalker, with care of
			the droids -- but Artoo proved difficult to control. He left the homestead
			on his own, claiming he was on a mission to deliver a message to Obi-Wan Kenobi.
			It turned out to be true: the Princess had recorded a distress message for
			Obi-Wan, detailing what to do with the stolen plans kept inside the astromech.
			Meanwhile, the Empire began a massive hunt for the droids, leading stormtroopers

		    Upon landing, R2-D2 slipped into a murky swamp and was attacked by a giant
